Dear Delta,

I am writing to express my extreme disappointment with the service we have received on our recent flight with your airline. We were scheduled to fly from LAS to LAX. 

We were told at the gate that we were not checked in, even though that had been done well in advance and, there being no other way to be at the airport without a boarding pass, the point seemed rather moot to begin with. Consequently, we would not be able to board our flight, which would lead to my missing a subsequent flight to Europe (Paris via Dublin.)

If the job of the team at the gate was to solve our issue, they have thoroughly failed by doing nothing about it: We could not board our flight before other stand-by (!) passengers had done so, even though we had our tickets booked for that flight and had checked in with plenty of anticipation. They did nothing to help us. We were not offered priority, nor other flights, nor even a bump in the priority list.

If their job was to de-escalate the situation, they have failed by immediately escalating it instead. It is hard to overstate the gate team's insensitivity and rudeness. We were at first told that we had been called up three times at the gate, as if being present there was somehow our responsibility (we were at the amex lounge) or they did not have several ways to reach us (phone? email?) of which none were even tried. When complaining, one of the employees at the gate has even went as far as to shushing me!
The other employee signalled that my missing my transatlantic flight was somehow going to be my fault for having booked two legs of my trip with different airlines. 

I will not spend more time in this message, hoping that a feeling of propriety will encourage you, the airline, to rectify the situation in an amicable manner. The result of the inconvenience, for which the fault was fully on the side of the airline, was a very stressful half an hour and the knowledge that if I could board the flight at all and make it to my final destination it was merely by the coincidence of other passengers missing such flight, since nothing was done by your team to remedy the situation. 

Do we, as passengers, really need to point out that whatever happens in your internal system is not our problem? Or that to take us to our destination, once we have checked-in and arrived to the gate on time, is the airline’s contractual obligation? I really hope it isn’t, and that Delta will be willing and keen to rectify this issue.

Regards,
Silvio Di Stefano
