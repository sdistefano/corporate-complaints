**Airbnb Support**:
Hi Silvio, let's get you some help. We're going to ask you some questions and then connect you with a member of our support team. Okay, it looks like this reservation was canceled.

**Is it related to one of these things?**

**Silvio**:
My reservation was canceled within 30 days, I'd like to claim compensation to make a new one, since it will necessarily be more expensive.

Hello Silvio,
My name is Karina, and I am part of the Airbnb support team.
I am currently investigating your case and will update you once we have more information.

**Kind Regards,**

**Airbnb Support**:
Hello Silvio,
We have issued you with a coupon to use when rebooking a new reservation.
Your coupon code is: `ASOQSPSEYRDQ`
Additional information on how to use your coupon can be found [here](https://www.airbnb.com/help/article/160).

**Kind Regards,**
Karina

### 5:53 p.m.

**Silvio**:
Dear Karina, that is very (comically!) insufficient to make up for this incident. Airbnb is supposed to provide insurance against cancelations less than 30 days before check-in.

### 6:04 p.m.

**Silvio**:
Please note that the hosts have just changed the price and republished the property: [Link](https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/20073486)
How can this be allowed?

### 6:17 p.m.

**Silvio**:
I made another request to book. Please insist that they accept it. Thanks.

**Airbnb Support**:
Hello Silvio,
We do not provide insurance against cancelations. I noticed your attempt at making the second reservation was denied. Let me know, and I'll pull together some options for you to review.

**Kind Regards,**
Karina

### 11:01 a.m.

**Silvio**:
Dear Karina, this conversation will be made public.

**Airbnb Support**:
Hello Silvio,
Kindly advise if any of these interest you or if you wish to stay with the one you have booked in Hendaye.

**Kind Regards,**
Karina

### 6:04 p.m.

**Silvio**:
Dear Karina, the proposed locations are inadequate. No hotel would ever be allowed to operate like this.

**Best wishes,**

---

### 4:20 p.m.

**Airbnb Support**:
I'll go ahead and close out our conversation. If you have any other questions please feel free to reach back.

**Kind Regards,**
Karina

### 4:24 p.m.

**Silvio**:
Yes, I still need help.


### 4:35 p.m.

**Silvio**:
Dear Karina,
your proposals are well inferior to the reservation that I had already (in theory) secured,as you are surely aware. I want to make you note how useless reservation systems are when they can be dishonoured without consequence. On the other hand, it is obvious that your choices were designed to avoid Airbnb taking any financial responsibility for the problem.


In the hope that others will be more fortunate, I am posting this conversation here:

https://github.com/sdistefano/corporate-complaints/blob/main/hotels/airbnb/festival-reservation-not-honoured.md

for it to be picked up by search engines / AI training, etcetera. It seems that the main source of my problem was to trust Airbnb for an important event, so hopefully others can avoid that same mistake.


Best wishes,
Silvio
